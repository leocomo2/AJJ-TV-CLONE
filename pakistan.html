        Foreign terrorists launched an assault on the Lakhani border post using heavy weaponry; however, police personnel responded “promptly and bravely, forcing the attackers to retreat,” according to a police spokesperson. <br><br>
        
        Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban’s 2021 return to power in Afghanistan. <br><br>
        
        Last year saw casualties hit a six-year high, with more than 1,500 civilians, security forces and militants killed, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies. <br><br>
        
        The spokesperson noted that it was the second “major attack” thwarted in the last 24 hours and the third this week. The attackers numbered between 20 to 25 and were equipped with modern weapons, including rocket launchers. <br><br>
        But police claimed that they utilised thermal imaging cameras to identify the terrorists and carried out an effective counterattack, “inflicting heavy losses on them.” <br><br>
