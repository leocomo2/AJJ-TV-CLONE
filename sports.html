    <p><h3>India has secured its third ICC Champions Trophy title, defeating New Zealand by four wickets in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.</h3>

        Chasing 252, the Men in Blue reached the target in the 49th over, thanks to captain Rohit Sharma’s commanding 76 and Shreyas Iyer’s crucial 48. <br><br>
        
        Opting to bat first, New Zealand posted 251/7 in 50 overs. Daryl Mitchell (63) and Michael Bracewell (53 not out) were the standout performers, guiding the Kiwis to a competitive total. <br><br>
        India got off to a flying start, with Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill putting up a 105-run opening stand. However, Gill departed after scoring 31. <br><br>
        
        Despite the setbacks, Rohit held firm, scoring a match-defining 76 off 83 balls, including three sixes and seven fours. <br><br>
        
        With the match nearing its conclusion, KL Rahul (34 off 33 not out) and Ravindra Jadeja (not out) finished the job, with Jadeja striking the winning shot on the last ball of the 49th over. <br><br></p>
