    <h1>Business</h1>
    <p><h3>The Finance Division has directed the Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) to launch digital prize bonds, which are aimed at promoting a paperless system, reducing costs associated with printing and logistics.</h3>

        “Soon CDNS will offer Digital Prize Bonds as well and the prize money will be directly credited to customers’ account,” the CDNS, a subsidiary of the State Bank of Pakistan, said in a statement. <br><br>
        
        “This will reduce expenditure on stationary and printing. It will also create ease for customers’ as there will not be a need to keep the prize bonds in a safe custody as required currently with paper based prize bonds.”<br><br>
        
        The decision would fill the gap left by the discontinuation of bearer prize bonds, according to The News. Such bonds would be registered in the buyer’s name, thereby decreasing the risks of theft, damage, or loss. <br><br>
        
        The initial offerings would include digital prize bonds in denominations of Rs500, Rs1,000, Rs5,000, and Rs10,000, according to a finance ministry summary. <br><br>
        
        An eligible person would be able to buy digital prize bonds through the National Savings Mobile App or other CDNS-approved channels.</p>
