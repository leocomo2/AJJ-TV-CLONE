    <p><h3>Iran said on Sunday it would consider nuclear negotiations with the United States, but only as they pertained to external concerns of the “potential militarisation” of the programme — rather than a total shutdown.</h3>

        The post on X by Iran’s mission to the United Nations came a day after the country’s supreme leader slammed what he described as “bullying” tactics, insisting on negotiations after US President Donald Trump threatened military action. <br>
        The post was referring to the nuclear accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), struck between Tehran and major powers in 2015 under then-US president Barack Obama. <br><br>

        The deal had offered relief from sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. <br>
        
        Trump abandoned it during his first term, in 2018, and reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran. Tehran abided by the terms for another year before beginning to roll back on its own commitments. <br><br>
        
        It has since sharply ramped up its enrichment of uranium far beyond the limits set by the JCPOA. <br>
        
        US officials now estimate that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it chose to do so. <br>
        
        On Friday, Trump said he had written to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging new talks on the country’s nuclear program but warning of possible military action if it refuses. <br></p>
